== Description ==

This plugins automates the generation of pricefiles for price comparison services. 

The plugin supports Prisjakt/Pricespy and Pricerunner. Support for Google Shopping/Google Merchant Center and Kelkoo was planned, but is on hold due to limited demand. If you want this, send me a message and if enough people do, I will reconsider.

This plugin required PHP version 5.3+.
