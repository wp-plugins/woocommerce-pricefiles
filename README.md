WooCommerce-Pricefiles
======================

Generate pricefiles for integration with price comparison services.

For more information, visit the plugin page on WordPress.org: https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pricefiles/
I strongly recomend downloading the plugin from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pricefiles/) and not from GitHub because the versions are tested before they are uploaded there.


###Supported services
 -  [Prisjakt](http://www.prisjakt.nu/ "").
 -  [Pricerunner](http://www.pricerunner.se/ "").
 -  [Kelkoo](http://www.kelkoo.com/ "") (On hold. Will be developed if I feel there is enough sufficient demand. If you want it send me a message.).
 -  [Google Merchant Center](https://www.google.com/merchants/merchantdashboard "") (On hold. There are other plugins for this. Duplication of efforts vs all-in-one solution).



###TODO
- [WC Brands](http://www.woothemes.com/products/brands/ "WC Brands on WooThemes.com") integration 
- Support for variable products
- Rewrite and refactor the cron+cache functionality 
- More info on how to genereate pricefiles with cron and cache
- More admin options(If you want anything specific, send me a message and I will consider it)
- Add more services, including Kelkoo and Google Shopping/Google Merchant
